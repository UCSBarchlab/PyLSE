# PyLSE
A Python embedded Language for Superconductor Electronics. 

PyLSE provides classes for the Pulse-Transfer Level design, simulation, and verification of superconductor electronics.

## Installation
To install PyLSE, do the following from the current directory.

1. First install the requirements:
    ```
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Then install the PyLSE package to your system via **one** of the following:

    1. Normal installation:
        ```
        pip3 install .
        ```

    2. Editable installation (i.e. you plan on making changes to PyLSE itself):
        ```
        pip3 install -e .
        ```

The above commands have been tested to work with Python 3.8 and Python 3.9. If you have one or both of those installed, you may need to replace the `pip3` commands above with `pip3.8` or `pip3.9`, respectively, for a more targeted installation.
